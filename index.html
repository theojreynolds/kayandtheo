                Hi Kay! It’s been exactly one year (that’s 365 days) since we met. Isn’t that absolutely mental? I made a little something for us to look back on our journey together. I really hope you like it. Happy anniversary darling!

                    <p>We met at a cute little coffee shop. You said hi to me first. And you fell in love with my weird (cute?) pick up line.</p>

                    <p>During our first couple of weeks together, we hung out a lot. I took you to very random places. All of them wintry, because you had mentioned that winter was your favourite season. After a while we got bored of the snow and the cold, but never of each other. </p>

                    <h3>1 week</h3>
                    <p>You did a very bold thing within our first week of dating. You told me you loved me. This could be completely false, but I think I was leaving for tennis or some other thing, when you told me to take care and then said those three words. I didn’t respond to it, because I hadn’t felt that way about you <i>yet</i>.</p>

                    <p>This was the night you first told me about your heart condition. I’d never wanted to envelop someone in a hug as badly as I did in that moment with you. You said that you’d understand if I wanted to leave you now. But I said no, I’d stay.</p>

                    <p>I couldn’t leave you hanging on those words for much longer. I remember we were having a heartfelt conversation, I don’t know about what, possibly about your heart. But at the end of it you told me again that you loved me. And that I didn’t have to say it back. But I wanted to prove you wrong. So I said it back. And I meant it.</p>

I was upset that you hid it from me. And I was envious that I wasn’t your first. But you gave me the reassurances that I needed, like you always manage to do.</p>

You had fainted on the way to school the day before, and I didn’t hear from you for more than 36 hours. When you did eventually message me, I was so angry and didn’t talk to you that day. You didn’t know why, but I think even though I was so relieved you were okay, I was also angry at you for putting me through that fear. It was not your fault, of course.</p>

                    <p>This is when we ended. I couldn’t trust you, and you said there is no relationship without trust, so I broke up with you. I was angry. We had been patchy at best throughout the previous week, little irritation here and there, at least on my part. And I reached a breaking point. I will always regret what I did. Because I hurt you, and because of what happened afterwards.</p>

I woke up to your messages panicking that I was upset with you, when I didn’t even know what had happened yet. When you told me though, unlike 26 December, it didn’t feel like a punch to the stomach or like my heart had been ripped out. Because I had seen it coming.

                    <p>I kissed you! For the previous week we had been getting really close again with each other, spending a lot of time together. One day you fainted at school and had to stay at the hospital. You messaged me saying you would really like some cuddles, but that you’d given up hope of me kissing you back. At the time I actually was scared to do it, because I knew what would eventually happen if we kissed. I didn’t want to hurt you and mess us up again. But, my wants were stronger than my fears, so I kissed you. And apparently even until today, that was the hottest kiss I’ve ever given you.</p>

                    <p>Valentine’s date. Since Valentine’s was on a school day, we decided to celebrate it early. You took us to a very cute place to take pictures. I was obsessed with your hair and red skirt. I was even more obsessed when we got home though, because you put on your very first scandalous outfit. And later that night, you said to me, “I wanna make love to you.” Immense butterflies.</p>

                    <p>This was our first big argument after getting back together. We argued about three things, and got angry and irritated with each other. Notice how this is almost three months after we got back together? I remember thinking at the time, is this our limit? Because last time, when we almost reached three months, we fought too, and that ended in our split. I never wanted or thought about splitting up with you again, I was just scared of the possibility of that happening. Fortunately, after nearly 14 hours of talking, we managed to work things out.</p>

                    <p>We’ve both gone through so much this past year. Our relationship hasn’t been smooth sailing, at all. There was a time when we thought we would never see each other again. There were times when we would argue, and in our anger, we would only see the hurt, forgetting about our affection for each other. But we would always work it out. And we would grow stronger by the end of it.</p>

I know I can be difficult to put up with, especially when I’m in one of my irritable moods, as I have often been these couple of months. Always, you show me endless love and kindness.</p>
                    <p>Every day I think about how lucky I am to have you. And I can’t help but pray the same blessing for everyone out there.</p>
