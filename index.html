            <p>
                Hi Kay! It’s been exactly one year (that’s 365 days) since we met. I think that’s absolutely mental. I made a little something to look back on our journey together. I hope you like it. Happy anniversary darling!

                    <p>We met at a cute little coffee shop. You said hi to me first. And you fell in love with my weird (cute?) pick up line.</p>

                    <p>During our first couple of weeks together, we hung out a lot. I took you to very random places. All of them wintry, because you had mentioned that winter was your favourite season. After a while we got bored of the snow and the cold, but never of each other. </p>

                    <h3>1 week</h3>
                    <p>You did a very bold thing within our first week of dating. You told me you loved me. This could be completely false, but I think I was leaving for tennis or some other thing, when you told me to take care and then said those three words. I didn’t respond to it, because I hadn’t felt that way about you <i>yet</i>.</p>

                    <p>This was the night you first told me about your heart condition. I’d never wanted to envelop someone in a hug as badly as I did in that moment with you. You said that you’d understand if I wanted to leave you now. But I said no, I’d stay.</p>

                    <p>I couldn’t leave you hanging on those words for much longer. I remember we were having a heartfelt conversation, I don’t know about what, possibly about your heart. But at the end of it you told me again that you loved me. And that I didn’t have to say it back. But I wanted to prove you wrong. So I said it back. And I meant it.</p>

I was showing you the letters I had written in the Google document. We were cold towards each other, which is understandable. But by the end of it you said this, and I wanted to cry.</p>

But then we didn’t talk at all for 6 days. You thought that I was upset with you, but I was just giving you some space … to let you move on from me.

I do, and remembering about it now is bringing me to tears because of how scared I felt, how terrified I was of losing you.

I woke up to your messages panicking that I was upset with you, when I didn’t even know what had happened yet.
